        <h2>
            Dear Mom,
        </h2>
        <p>
            First I would Like to say that I love you And appreciate everything that you sacrificed to give me a very blessed childhood. In the past few years as I have grown in maturity and understanding I have come to appreciate you more and more. Your continued growth and pursuit of knowledge inspire me to try harder. I have learned more from you than school or teachers could ever teach me. I will never be able to pay back the lifetime of knowledge you have given me, but I will continue to try my best to make you proud that I am your son. I hope to continue to learn from you and love you forever. You are one of the most intelligent people I have ever met and I have loved watching your growth in a difficult time of questioning your beliefs and the understanding that you have gained. It shows strength to question and think independently from what you have lived and been taught your whole life. Again I want to say that I love, appreciate, and respect you.
        </p>
