  1 tablespoon cornstarch
  1 cup beef broth
  1/4 cup A-1 steak sauce
  1-2 teaspoons steak seasoning

  Add beef broth, steak sauce, steak seasoning. Bring to a low boil and then turn down heat to medium-low and let simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid is absorbed. It will thicken a little bit more once taken off the heat.
  While beef is cooking toast your buns and cheese. Separate hamburger buns and place tops and bottom onto the cookie sheet. Place a slice of cheese on the bottom bun, and then broil on high for 2-3 minutes.

  Steak
  1 lb. ground round
  1/3 cup Italian flavored breadcrumbs
  1 egg
  2 Tbs. ketchup 
  1 Tbs. Worcestershire sauce
  1 tsp. Dijon mustard
  2 Tbs, fresh parsley chopped
       Gravy
  1 Tbs. olive oil
  3 Tbs. butter divided
  1 medium onion sliced
  2 cloves garlic grated
  4 oz. mushrooms sliced
  2 Tbs. flour
  3 cups beef stock

  1 tsp. Dijon mustard
  1 Tbs. Worcestershire sauce
  1 tsp. dried thyme
  Instructions:
  In a medium bowl combine the Salisbury Steak ingredients,  divide the meat forming it into 5 or 6 oval-shaped patties about an 3/4″ thick and season them all with salt and pepper on both sides.
  Heat the oil and one tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat then add the patties searing on both sides and transfer them to a plate (they won’t be cooked through at this point).
  Add the onions, garlic and mushrooms to the same skillet and sauté, browning lightly. Season with salt and pepper then lower the heat to medium and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter to the skillet.
  When the butter melts whisk in the flour and cook over low heat 1 minute. Pour in beef stock, McCormick Au jus mix, Dijon, Worcestershire sauce and thyme scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet stirring as the gravy thickens.
  Once the gravy thickens, nestle the  beef into the gravy and pour in any leftover juices from the plate. Cover and cook over low heat about 10 minutes or until the beef is cooked through.
  
  
  Taste and adjust salt and pepper as necessary and if the gravy is too thick, splash in more beef stock a couple of tablespoons at a time.
